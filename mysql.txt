#Here are the MySQL queries to accomplish the same stuff that's in the main ipynb
#The database in the following queries is chipotle, and is identical to the one in the ipynb

#In MySQL, we use similar syntax to convert the item price from a string to a float
#First remove the dollar sign with:
UPDATE chipotle SET price = REPLACE(price, '$', '');

#Then convert it to a decimal type:
UPDATE chipotle SET price = CONVERT(price, DECIMAL(10,2));

#Top 5 most popular items
SELECT item, COUNT(item) FROM chipotle GROUP BY item ORDER BY COUNT(item) DESC LIMIT 5;
