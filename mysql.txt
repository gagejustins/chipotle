#Here are the MySQL queries to accomplish the same stuff that's in the main ipynb
#The database in the following queries is chipotle, and is identical to the one in the ipynb

#In MySQL, we use similar syntax to convert the item price from a string to a float
#First remove the dollar sign with:
UPDATE chipotle SET price = REPLACE(price, '$', '');

#Then convert it to a decimal type:
UPDATE chipotle SET price = CONVERT(price, DECIMAL(10,2));

#Top 5 most popular items
SELECT item, COUNT(item) FROM chipotle GROUP BY item ORDER BY COUNT(item) DESC LIMIT 5;

#Distribution of order prices (h/t https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1764881/getting-data-for-histogram-plot)
SELECT ROUND(price, -1)            AS bucket,
       COUNT(*)                    AS COUNT,
       RPAD('', LN(COUNT(*)), '*') AS bar
FROM   chipotle
GROUP  BY bucket;

#Distribution of revenue
SELECT ROUND(quantity*price, -1)    AS bucket,
       COUNT(*)                     AS COUNT,
       RPAD('', LN(COUNT(*)), '*')  AS bar
FROM   chipotle
GROUP  BY bucket;

#Top 20 orders by total revenue
SELECT order_id, sum(quantity*price) AS revenue FROM chipotle GROUP BY order_id ORDER BY revenue DESC LIMIT 20;
